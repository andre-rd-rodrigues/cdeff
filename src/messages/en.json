The Club is part of the Escola Secund√°ria Francisco Franco, in the city of Funchal, whose main message is about unity and the formation of a school community directly related to sports, not only considering the competitive aspect but above all the educational aspect. Currently, it has approximately 150 athletes registered in all training categories between the ages of 5 and 19, including a senior women's team that stands out in the Women's Basketball I League. CDEFF seeks to create habits of occupying young people's free time through sports, complementing school activities, promoting well-being, health, adherence to rules, and their social integration. Our main goal is to train and prepare athletes for the future, both sportively and personally, always including the values of sport and life, justifying the growth in the number of athletes who want to be trained at our Club."

Thus increasing self-confidence, socialization, physical and mental well-being, also enjoying the surroundings with the environment and nature.\nFor more information, please contact us."
